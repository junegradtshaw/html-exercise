      <h1>
        Cities Where I Have Lived
      </h1>
      <p>I was born in Suffolk England.  I then moved to cities as my family was transferred with the military.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suffolk<span>&#33</span></li>
        <li>Raleigh<span>&#33</span></li>
        <li>Pensacola<span>&#33</span></li>
        <li>Honolulu<span>&#33</span></li>
        <li>Aurora<span>&#33</span></li>
        <li>Evergreen<span>&#33</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h1>
        Cities I Would Like to Visit
      </h1>
      <p>I would love to see ancient history in Jerusalem.  I speak some Spanish, and would love to see Spain. Australia seems like a country with diverse attractions, especially the opera house in Sydney.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jerusalem</strong></li>
        <li><em>Barcelona</em></li>
        <li><strong>Sydney</strong></li>
      </ul>
