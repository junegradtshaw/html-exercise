  <h1>

  <p>I was born in Suffolk England.  I then moved to cities as my family was transferred with the military.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Suffolk<span>&#33</span></li>
    <li>Raleigh<span>&#33</span></li>
    <li>Pensacola<span>&#33</span></li>
    <li>Honolulu<span>&#33</span></li>
    <li>Aurora<span>&#33</span></li>
    <li>Evergreen<span>&#33</span></li>
  </ul>

  <h1>
    Cities I Would Like to Visit
  </h1>
  <p>I would love to see ancient history in Jerusalem.  I speak some Spanish, and would love to see Spain. Australia seems like a country with diverse attractions, especially the opera house in Sydney.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Jerusalem</strong></li>
    <li><em>Barcelona</em></li>
    <li><strong>Sydney</strong></li>
  </ul>
